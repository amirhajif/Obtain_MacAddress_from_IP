in this project first thing you do is :
1-download and install nmap : https://nmap.org/download.html
2-next install requierments :  pip install -r requirements.txt

now you can run the program. when you run , it asks you to enter an ip address like 192.16.1.1/24 . and after you enter the ip address , it takes a bit long to show mac address and reslts, so please be patient.
