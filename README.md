# Obtain_MacAddress_From_IP

in this project first thing you do is : 

1-download and install nmap : https://nmap.org/download.html 2-next install requierments : pip install -r requirements.txt 3-in main.py line 22 change nmap_path to where nmap.exe is installed in your computer

now you can run the program. when you run , it asks you to enter an ip address like 192.16.1.1/24 . and after you enter the ip address , it takes a bit long to show mac address and reslts, so please be patient.
